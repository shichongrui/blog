In highschool I really got into electronics and in researching and watching what people had done with electronics I came upon the Ben Heck website and forums. I was hooked and wanted to build my own portable gaming system. As a senior in high school, I didn't have a job and I wasn't feeling very challenged in school, so I decided to make my first portable, a Sega Dreamcast.
